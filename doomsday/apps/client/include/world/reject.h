/**
 * The REJECT resource is a LUT that provides the results of trivial
 * line-of-sight tests between sectors. This is done with a matrix of sector
 * pairs i.e. if a monster in sector 4 can see the player in sector 2; the
 * inverse should be true.
 *
 * Note however, some PWADS have carefully constructed REJECT data to create
 * special effects. For example it is possible to make a player completely
 * invissible in certain sectors.
 *
 * The format of the table is a simple matrix of dd_bool values, a (true)
 * value indicates that it is impossible for mobjs in sector A to see mobjs
 * in sector B (and vice-versa). A (false) value indicates that a
 * line-of-sight MIGHT be possible and a more accurate (thus more expensive)
 * calculation will have to be made.
 *
 * The table itself is constructed as follows:
 *
 *     X = sector num player is in
 *     Y = sector num monster is in
 *
 *         X
 *
 *       0 1 2 3 4 ->
 *     0 1 - 1 - -
 *  Y  1 - - 1 - -
 *     2 1 1 - - 1
 *     3 - - - 1 -
 *    \|/
 *
 * These results are read left-to-right, top-to-bottom and are packed into
 * bytes (each byte represents eight results). As are all lumps in WAD the
 * data is in little-endian order.
 *
 * Thus the size of a valid REJECT lump can be calculated as:
 *
 *     ceiling(numSectors^2)
 *
 * For now we only do very basic reject processing, limited to determining
 * all isolated sector groups (islands that are surrounded by void space).
 *
 * @note Algorithm:
 * Initially all sectors are in individual groups. Next, we scan the line
 * list. For each 2-sectored line, merge the two sector groups into one.
