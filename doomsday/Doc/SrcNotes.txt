RELEASE NOTES:

The Doomsday Engine source code is distributed under the GNU General Public
License (see LICENSE in the root directory).

The code in this package was used to build the 1.7.15 release.

The placement of some files was changed in 1.7.6; you shouldn't install
this package on top of a previous Doomsday Sources tree unless it's newer
than 1.7.6.

The source code is more or less in a state of disarray. This tends to
happen when you take three separate code bases and try to fit them
together. The files of the engine, many of which I've written myself from
scratch, are more organized but lack a coherent style. Things like function
header comments, variable naming conventions and the use of whitespace have
varied over time and been influenced by the various styles used in the
original Doom, Heretic and Hexen sources. You'll find that much of the code
is not very pretty.

MISCELLANEOUS. This Agreement represents the complete agreement concerning
this license between the parties and supersedes all prior agreements and
representations between them. It may be amended only by a writing executed
by both parties. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be
unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be reformed only to the
