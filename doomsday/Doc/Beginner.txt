1. INSTALLATION

What do you need?

* One of the self-extracting distribution archives:

    File name                   Contains
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    doomsday_(date).exe         Doomsday, jDoom, jHeretic, jHexen
    jdoom(version).exe          Doomsday, jDoom
    jheretic(version).exe       Doomsday, jHeretic
    jhexen(version).exe         Doomsday, jHexen

  All can be downloaded from http://www.doomsdayhq.com/ or directly from:

    ftp://jfiles@server1.thefourwinds.net/

* 3D models are distributed in separate archives:

    jdoom_mpack.exe
    jheretic_mpack.exe
    jhexen_mpack.exe

* Windows 95 (or newer).

* DirectX 6.0 (or newer).

* A display adapter with 3D hardware acceleration.

* A copy of the original shareware/registered Doom, Doom II, Final Doom,
  shareware/registered Heretic, Hexen or Hexen: Deathkings of the Dark
  Citadel, depending on what you're going to play.

...........................................................................
1.1  Step 1: Uncompress the distribution

Run the distribution EXE file. A window appears asking you where the files
should be extracted. The default folder is "C:\Doomsday". You might want to
change it something like "C:\Games\Doomsday" or "C:\Program
Files\Doomsday". Click the Install button to begin the installation.

When the files have been extracted, you can run the EXE file of the model
pack, for instance jdoom_mpack.exe. Be sure to extract the model files in
the same directory as you extracted the distribution. The default is
"C:\Doomsday" here, as well. The model pack is not required; you don't have
to install it at all, or you might install it at some later point in time.

Even if you're only going to play one of the games, for example jDoom, it's
recommended that you install the files into a folder named "Doomsday" (or
something similar), not "jDoom" because if you later decide to install
jHeretic or jHexen they should be installed into the same folder with
jDoom. It's possible to install them into separate folders but then you've
got multiple copies of the same files on your hard drive. (Assuming you
care about a few MBs or the names of your folders.)

...........................................................................
1.2  Step 2: Copy the WAD files

The only thing you need from the original Doom, Heretic, Hexen, etc. is an
IWAD file. It is the large (over 10 MBs) WAD file you can find in the
folder where you've got the original game installed. It contains all the
game maps, sprites, sounds, graphics and other data. The names of the
various IWADs are listed below:

Game DLL    Original Game       IWAD Files
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
jDoom       Shareware Doom      DOOM1.WAD
jDoom       Registered Doom     DOOM.WAD
jDoom       Doom II             DOOM2.WAD
jDoom       Final Doom          TNT.WAD and PLUTONIA.WAD
jHeretic    Heretic             HERETIC.WAD
jHexen      Hexen               HEXEN.WAD
jHexen      Hexen: Deathkings   HEXDD.WAD (HEXEN.WAD needed as well)

Let's assume that in Step 1 you extracted the files in "C:\Doomsday". It is
recommended that you copy (or move if you don't play the original game any
more) the IWAD files you need into the appropriate Data subfolder, in
jDoom's case "C:\Doomsday\Data\jDoom". If you don't do this you'll need to
specify the IWAD to use when launching the game.

NOTE! Make sure you're using the latest version of the original game.
      Patches can be found by searching the internet for "doom patch" or
      something similar. Also check http://www.idsoftware.com/.

...........................................................................
1.3  Step 3: Run glBSP on the WAD files

glBSP (by Andrew Apted) is a program that calculates map data in a way
which is more accurate and more useful for 3D rendering than the data found
in the original WAD files. Running glBSP will greatly reduce the number of
graphics errors like stray pixels and missing floors, ceilings and walls.
In most cases all graphics errors can be fixed by running glBSP.

The Doomsday KickStart launcher can automatically check for the existance
of data files produced by glBSP and build them if necessary, so you can
skip this step if you make sure the option "Check if glBSP needs to be run"
is checked on KickStart's "Other" tab.

Open the DOS Prompt and change to the folder where you extracted the files
in Step 1. All the distributions include a text mode version of glBSP, so
all you need to do is give the following commands (for all IWAD files you
copied in Step 2):

    glbsp data\jdoom\doom.wad
    glbsp data\jdoom\doom2.wad
      :
    (etc.)
      :
    glbsp data\jhexen\hexdd.wad

If you didn't copy the IWADs to the Data folder, you must naturally give
the full path to glBSP, for example:

    glbsp d:\games\heretic\heretic.wad

For the latest version go to http://glbsp.sourceforge.net/.

...........................................................................
1.4  Step 4: Create a shortcut for KickStart

The main launcher for games running on the Doomsday Engine is called
Doomsday KickStart. It can be found in the folder where you extracted the
files in Step 1 (Kicks.exe). To have a convenient way to start the game
create a Windows shortcut for Kicks.exe.

===========================================================================
2. STARTING A GAME

...........................................................................
2.1  Starting with KickStart

Doomsday KickStart is the easiest way to start playing jDoom, jHeretic or
jHexen. Select the profile you want from the list and click Play.

You can create new profiles by right-clicking the profile list.

Note that only the "Game" and "Definitions" tabs are profile-specific. The
"Graphics" and "Other" tabs are common to all profiles.

If you want to see the command line KickStart uses to start the game,
right-click the Play button.

NOTE! KickStart is a Visual Basic program so it requires a couple of
      runtime libraries/support files. With any luck you should already
      have all the necessary files, but if you don't you need to download
      the "KickStart Full Install" from the DoomsdayHQ Utilities page
      (http://www.doomsdayhq.com/download_util.shtml).

...........................................................................
2.2  Starting with the Simple Launchers

The Simple Launchers are small EXE files found in the folder where you
installed the game (jDoom.exe, jHeretic.exe, jHexen.exe). They can only be
run in the root Doomsday folder, which is "C:\Doomsday" by default. They
just change to the correct runtime folder (e.g. "Run\jDoom") and execute
Doomsday.exe with the appropriate command line options (-gl, -game,
-userdir, -basedir; see Doc\CmdLine.txt).

The simple launchers have one command line option of their own: -d3d. It'll
make the game use the Direct3D renderer instead of the OpenGL one, which is
used otherwise.

...........................................................................
2.3  Starting with batch files or from the DOS Prompt

If everything else fails you can always start the game from the DOS Prompt.
For an example batch file see Doc\Example.bat.

For information about the handling of file names on the command line see
Doc\Readme.txt. For a list of command line options see Doc\CmdLine.txt.

...........................................................................
2.4  jDoom: Options for overriding game detection

If you've got multiple IWADs in your "Data\jDoom" folder and you start the
game from a batch file or from the DOS Prompt you can use the following
command line options to make jDoom use the IWAD you want:

Option                      Game
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-sdoom                      Shareware Doom (DOOM1.WAD)
-doom (same as -ultimate)   Registered or Ultimate Doom (DOOM.WAD)
-doom2                      Doom II (DOOM2.WAD)
-tnt                        Final Doom (TNT.WAD)
-plutonia                   Final Doom (PLUTONIA.WAD)

If you don't use one of these options and you don't specify an IWAD with
the -iwad command line option, jDoom will use the first IWAD it comes
across. The folders searched are "Data\jDoom", "Data", the root Doomsday
folder and "Run\jDoom".

===========================================================================
3. LOADING WADS

There are two kinds of WAD files: IWADs and PWADs. IWADs are usually large
and contain all kinds of data like maps, sprites, sounds and graphics.
PWADs (Patch WADs) are smaller and in addition to new data they may contain
data that will replace some parts of an IWAD, for instance a single map.
Both IWADs and PWADs consist of one or more named blocks of data called
lumps.

KickStart won't start a game unless an IWAD file is listed and checked in
the WAD Files list.

...........................................................................
3.1  Loading in KickStart

Click the Add and Remove buttons under the WAD Files list to add and remove
WAD files. All the checked files will be loaded when you start the game.

...........................................................................
3.2  Loading in the console

It's possible to load WAD files at runtime in the console. When you've got
the game running, open the console with the Tilde key. To load the WAD file
COOL.WAD from the runtime folder (e.g. Run\jDoom), use the following
command:

    load cool.wad

You can also give the full path of the file:

    load d:\games\doom\super.wad

The command "listfiles" will print a list of all the currently loaded data
files. You can unload files that have been loaded at runtime with the
"unload" command, for example:

    unload cool.wad

...........................................................................
3.3  Loading with command line options

If you have the file COOL.WAD in the runtime folder (e.g. Run\jDoom), you
can use the command line option

    -file cool.wad

to load COOL.WAD at startup. Note that you can only use the -file option
once, so if you want to load multiple files you need to do the following:

    -file file1.wad file2.wad file3.wad

For detailed information about the handling of file names on the command
line see Doc\Readme.txt.
