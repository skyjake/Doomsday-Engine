DOOMSDAY EXECUTABLE PUBLIC API

This folder contains header files for the Doomsday Client and Server
executables' public APIs: all the functionality made available by the
executables at runtime. Plugins need to use these APIs for registering hooks
and accessing the engine's runtime functionality.

Note that in the future, more and more of this functionality will be moving
into the shared libraries.
