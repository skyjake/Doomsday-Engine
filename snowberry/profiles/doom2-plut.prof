story = "<i>Final Doom</i> is the last in the <i>Doom</i> games. It was made
not by <i>id Software</i> but by <i>TeamTNT</i> who also made the <i>Boom</i>
engine, an add-on made with the recently released source code. It contains
two new 32 level doom2 wads called 'Evilution' and 'The Plutonia Experiment',
heaps of new music and some new textures."
